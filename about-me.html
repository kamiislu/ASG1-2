                Hi, my name is Luismika Lim and I am 21 years old this year and I am currently studying in Ngee Ann
                Polytechnic's Information technology course. This course would help me gain the necessary skills
                and knowledge to be ready for the workforce in the future. I have served 2 years of mandatory
                National Service and it has helped me gain new perspectives on our society and it helps me empathise
                with end-users more easily which i believe would be a beneficial trait in the future. National
                Service also helped me improve my people skills and I am able to carry a conversation more
                convincingly now than i did before.
