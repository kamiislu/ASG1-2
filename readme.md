Website is intended to be a portfolio website for future employers or for myself to display my accolades, past work experience, skills and knowledge, and proof of my work with my projects. The website is segregated to easy digestible parts with clear concise information for the reader. The website is designed in such a way that will help the reader get to know me better.

## Design process:
My website is meant to act as a portfolio for myself which is for potential employers, fellow schoolmates and people in the same industry to get to know me better. My website would help them do so as it covers a brief introduction about myself in the "about-me" page and my website also consists of my past work experience, skills, technical abilities and review the projects that I have embarked on. The information is organised and coherent making navigation easy for the reader. The content is written in a clear and concise manner making it easy for readers to digest and comprehend.

### This is the wireframe design I initially planned to realise:
