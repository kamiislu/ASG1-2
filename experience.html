            <p><h2>Amazon Prime</h2>
                Amazon Prime provided me experience with warehouse operations and 
                allowed me to understand and experience first-hand the processes 
                that a multinational online retail company take to handle large 
                amounts of orders daily. Through working there i also learned 
                inventory and stock-taking methods that will be relevant if I am 
                to work in a similar industry in the future.

            <p><h2>Panasonic Factory Solutions</h2>
                During my time at Panasonic, the company was still new to the field
                 of indoor farming. Together with the company, we experimented and
                  found various ways and methods to improve our farming processes. 
                  Through this role, I also managed to interact with people from other 
                  countries with very different backgrounds that changed the perspectives 
                  of my young self back then.

            <p><h2>National Service</h2>
                I was enisted into an infantry mono-intake battalion in 2019. It was
                a tough and gruelling 3 years and through those experiences i have 
                learnt to not take things for granted. The arduous outfields and the
                very memorable Exercise in Brunei have made me a more resilient person
                who has the grit to get going in tough times.
